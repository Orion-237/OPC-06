| Criteria        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lisibility      | ✅Overall the code is well structured with separation of concerns, the variable names are well chosen<br/> ❌ There are little to no comments on how things function<br/> 🤔Comments should be added                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Maintainability | ✅Thanks to the use of the ```menu()``` function the code could easily be extended to add new functionalities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Fonctionality   | ✅The code attempts to implement all the compulsory use cases of OPC-05 however there are many bugs<br/> ❌It is not possible to set create a free time frame on the current day<br/> ❌It does not prevent some conflicts<br/> ❌It does not handle entry of minutes<br/> ❌The interface is not very nice<br/> 🤔The code needs revision and further testing to fix these bugs<br/> 🤔Regular expressions may be used<br/> 🤔The console interface may be beautified perhaps with colors and good indentation |
| Optimisation    | ➖The question of performance is not yet a concern because of the small scope of the application however if the scope has to grow, concepts such as data structures or databases will be necessary<br/> ❌There is no data persistence<br/> 🤔Files should be used to store data                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Security        | ❌There is no security measure anyone can do anything<br/> 🤔Account creation and login features should be implemented                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
